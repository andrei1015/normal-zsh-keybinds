# what the fuck is wrong with this shell??

I found this [here](https://grml.org/zsh/) but it wasn't quite perfect. I didn't even look over it, have absolutely no fucking clue what it does, because I shouldn't have to spend multiple days to stop my shell from crapping itself. Changes I made:

-   I removed some stuff that changed how the prompt looks.
-   added ctrl+backspace and ctrl+delete to remove whole words
-   unbound some fzf stuff cause I dont like it

## what the fuck is this shit tho?

this all started when I noticed the Home and End and those buttons just acting weird, messing zsh up, capitalising random letters, shit like that. I've been told zsh users usually have a lot of custom keybinds but this shit is not normal. having to dig and accidentally stumble upon a 4000(!!!!!) line, community maintained config file, just to make zsh act like any other text area input, in its most basic of forms is not ok. what the fuck. the home and end buttons were created 50+ fucking years ago for this very specific and simple task. this is the only place i've seen crap itself so easily.

## how?

reddit was fucking useless. most of the web was ass. someone mentioned the grml thing on the Arch forums. kudos once more.
